# Quick Start üöÄ

Quick start to create a new Godot project.

## Project Setup

   1. Launch Godot

   2. Press create

   ![alt text](./ReadMeAssets/create.png "Header")

   3. Name your game & save to N drive.

   ![alt text](./ReadMeAssets/name&save.png "Header")

## 1. Godot Environment

   When we open our project, we‚Äôll be greeted with the default Godot Editor.

   1. Let's create a **2D Scene** on the left. This will switch our view from 3D to 2D. You can see this change on the top center bar (2D 3D Script AssetLib), you can click any of them to switch views.

   <img src="./ReadMeAssets/env1.png" alt="isolated" width="300"/>

   2. On the left side we have our Scene hierarchy with a Node2D as our root node. Since we‚Äôll be starting with a level, go ahead a rename it ***‚ÄúLevel‚Äù***

   3. Now save the level. ***Ctrl + S***, and then click save
   
   <img src="./ReadMeAssets/env2.png" alt="isolated" width="300"/>

## 2. Creating a player üïπÔ∏è

   Now we‚Äôre ready to start adding a player to our empty level.

   1. First, we‚Äôll need to add a new node to the scene, this node will be the basis of our player. Right click in the scene hierarchy and select ***‚Äú+Add Child Node‚Äù***. Search **‚ÄúCharacterBody2D‚Äù**, and click create. 
   
   This character body is what‚Äôs going to handle bumping into other objects and later will let our player move around.

   <img src="./ReadMeAssets/player1.png" alt="isolated" width="600"/>
   
   2. Name it **"Player"**.


   <img src="./ReadMeAssets/player2.png" alt="isolated" width="300"/>

   3. Next ***drag*** the **‚Äúicon.svg‚Äù** onto the scene view in the center. Then in the scene hierarchy on the left, drag the new Icon we just created onto the Player node to make it a child of the Player.

 <img src="./ReadMeAssets/player3_1.png" alt="isolated" width="300"/>
   
   ***Note: We‚Äôll use this as the visuals for our player.*** 

   4. Take a look at the warning sign that‚Äôs on our Player node. It‚Äôs telling us we need to specify what shape our character will use to collide with the world. 
   
   - Let‚Äôs add a new node again and add a **‚ÄúCollisionShape2D‚Äù**. Make sure it is a child of your player in the scene hierarchy. 

   <img src="./ReadMeAssets/player3.png" alt="isolated" width="300"/>

   5. Once again, we have another warning. Now make sure the **CollisionShape2D** node is selected in the scene hierarchy, and then look over at the Inspector on the right. At the very top we need to specify a shape. For now select a rectangle. 


   <img src="./ReadMeAssets/player4.png" alt="isolated" width="300"/>

   6. Now in the scene view a rectangle has popped up, we can resize this to fit over our sprite. The blue rectangle will inform our **CharacterBody2D** node what shape it is, so it knows how to calculate collisions.


   <img src="./ReadMeAssets/player5.png" alt="isolated" width="300"/>

   7. Now to finally play our scene. Click the play button on the top right and then choose ***‚Äúselect current"***. This will set our level as the default scene to play. If you haven‚Äôt saved your level, do so now.

   <img src="./ReadMeAssets/player6.png" alt="isolated" width="300"/>

   8. After some initial loading, we should see our player in the level!

   <img src="./ReadMeAssets/player7.png" alt="isolated" width="300"/>

---

   ### 2-b Player Movement
   
   Now as fun as it is to stare at the Godoplayer icon, most players are more interesting than a static image. Next we‚Äôll set up our player with some movement.

   1. Right click the Player node and select ‚ÄúAttach Script‚Äù

   <img src="./ReadMeAssets/player8.png" alt="isolated" width="300"/>

   2. We don‚Äôt need to change anything in this menu. The important part is that we are using Template: **CharacterBody2D: Basic Movement**. This will give us some basic player behavior out of the box. Go ahead and click **Create**.


   <img src="./ReadMeAssets/player9.png" alt="isolated" width="300"/>

   3. It will automatically open up in the Script view. Let‚Äôs navigate back to the 2D view
   
   ***We won‚Äôt be doing any scripting in this workshop, but feel free to come back and mess around in this script to learn how it works. GDScript is very similar to Python.***


   <img src="./ReadMeAssets/player10.png" alt="isolated" width="300"/>

   4. Now give the scene another run.

   5. Tada! Our player can now move around with arrow keys and is affected by gravity! Although there‚Äôs nothing to stand on so they keep falling into the void. Now it‚Äôs time to add something for our player to stand on.

---
   ### Player Overview
   
   <img src="./ReadMeAssets/player.png" alt="isolated" width="300"/>

   - **Node2D**‚§µ
      - Add a **CharacterBody2D**‚§µ
         - **Sprite2D** (Drag the Godot icon into the scene) 
          ***Note*** you might need to adjust the hierarchy. 
         - Add a **CollisionShape2D** and adjust the collision boundary to match the Sprite2D

   <img src="./ReadMeAssets/player.gif" alt="isolated" width="800"/>

---

## 3. Creating a platform

   1. To create our player we used a character body, to create level geometry we‚Äôll want a **StaticBody2D**. Right click on the **Level node** and then add a new StaticBody2D. Name it ***"Platform‚Äù***
   
   <img src="./ReadMeAssets/platform1.png" alt="isolated" width="300"/>


   2. Again we‚Äôll want to see our platform so drag out the **icon.svg** and stretch it into a platform. Make sure it is a child of the **StaticBody2D**

   <div>
   <img src="./ReadMeAssets/platform2.png" alt="isolated" width="800"/>

   <img src="./ReadMeAssets/platform3.png" alt="isolated" width="300"/>
   </div>
   
   <b>3.</b> Once again we have the same error needing a shape, so let‚Äôs add a **CollisionShape2D** and give it a rectangle shape in the inspector.
  ***Note: be sure not to copy paste any previous collision shapes or you may get strange behavior***

   <b>4.</b> Run the scene again!

   <b>5.</b> Now that you aren‚Äôt falling to you doom, the default controls are: walk around with arrow keys and jump with space.

  ---

   #### Plateform Overview

   <img src="./ReadMeAssets/plateform.png" alt="isolated" width="300"/>

   - **Node2D*
      - Add a **StaticBody2D**‚§µ
         - **Sprite2D** (Drag the Godot icon into the scene)
         - **CollisionShape2D** adjust the collision boundary

   <img src="./ReadMeAssets/plateform.gif" alt="isolated" width="800"/>

## 4. Adding a player camera

Our camera doesn‚Äôt track our player‚Äôs movements, we should change that.

1. Right click on your player and add a Camera2D.

   <img src="./ReadMeAssets/playerCam1.png" alt="isolated" width="300"/>

   <img src="./ReadMeAssets/playerCam2.png" alt="isolated" width="300"/>

2. This should already be enough, go ahead and give your scene a run!

3. Now the camera tracks our player as we‚Äôd expect, but it has a weird offset. To fix this, we‚Äôll first want to create a level of separation between our player and our level. To do this we need to make the player into its own scene. 
   
Right click the Player node and select ***‚ÄúSave Branch as Scene‚Äù***. Then save it.

 <img src="./ReadMeAssets/playerCam3.png" alt="isolated" width="300"/>

4. The player node is now collapsed and all its children aren‚Äôt visible anymore. This is because they were all moved into a new scene, and the player in the level is now an instance of our player scene. Don‚Äôt worry if that doesn‚Äôt make too much sense yet, we‚Äôll go over that soon.
   
Click on the player.tscn in the FileSystem to view the scene.

 <img src="./ReadMeAssets/playerCam4.png" alt="isolated" width="300"/>

 <img src="./ReadMeAssets/playerCam5.png" alt="isolated" width="300"/>

5. Here it might be more obvious why the camera is offset, it‚Äôs because the character collision and Icon aren‚Äôt lined up with the origin.
   
Select both the **Icon** and **CollisionShape2D** nodes, then open the Transform drop down in the inspector. And then click the arrow next to position to reset the position back to 0, 0.

<img src="./ReadMeAssets/playerCam6.png" alt="isolated" width="300"/>

<img src="./ReadMeAssets/playerCam7.png" alt="isolated" width="300"/>

<img src="./ReadMeAssets/playerCam8.png" alt="isolated" width="300"/>

6. While we‚Äôre here we might as well add some camera smoothing. Select the camera in the scene hierarchy, go to the inspector, and search ***‚Äúposition smoothing‚Äù*** and enable it.
   
If you don't like how this effect looks on your player while it's moving, you can disable smoothing.

<img src="./ReadMeAssets/playerCam9.png" alt="isolated" width="300"/>

<img src="./ReadMeAssets/playerCam10.png" alt="isolated" width="300"/>

7. Do ***Ctrl + S*** to save the scene, and then return back to the level to see the changes made.
   
<img src="./ReadMeAssets/playerCam11.png" alt="isolated" width="300"/>

8. The player got shifted to the origin of the level, but that‚Äôs okay, we can just drag it back into position.
   
<img src="./ReadMeAssets/playerCam12.png" alt="isolated" width="300"/>

9. Now with another run of the level, the camera should be aligned as intended.



---

## 5. Creating a physics object

Now that we have a level, it‚Äôs time to populate it with some objects we can have our player interact with.


1. Add a **RigidBody2D** and name it Crate
   
These are useful for an object with collision that we want to be able to push around.

2. Add the **icon** and the **CollisionShape2D** like in the previous steps.

<img src="./ReadMeAssets/physicBox1.png" alt="isolated" width="300"/>

3. Next we‚Äôre going build a quick tower, but it‚Äôs kind of difficult to drag the boxes around. So first we'll need to take a step back.
   
We‚Äôll want to turn this into a scene we can make instances of. Right click the Crate in the scene hierarchy and click ***‚ÄúSave Branch as Scene‚Äù***, then save.

<img src="./ReadMeAssets/physicBox2.png" alt="isolated" width="300"/>


4. To make edits to our crate now, we‚Äôll need to open up the **crate.tscn** in the File System.

<img src="./ReadMeAssets/physicBox3.png" alt="isolated" width="300"/>

5. Again, the Icon and **CollisionShape2D** aren‚Äôt aligned with the origin, let‚Äôs fix that.

***Note: make sure the search bar in the inspector is empty to ensure the Transform section shows up.***

<img src="./ReadMeAssets/physicBox4.png" alt="isolated" width="300"/>

<img src="./ReadMeAssets/physicBox5.png" alt="isolated" width="300"/>

<img src="./ReadMeAssets/physicBox6.png" alt="isolated" width="300"/>

6. Save with ***Ctrl + S*** and then back in the level the crate will need to be adjusted back into position.
   
7. Now make a little tower of crates. Select the **Crate** and you can use ***Ctrl + D*** to duplicate it

<img src="./ReadMeAssets/physicBox7.png" alt="isolated" width="300"/>

8. Run the level and try to knock over the tower.

9. We aren‚Äôt able to interact with the crates just yet because our player is also being blocked by the crates, so it isn‚Äôt able to push them. 

Go back into the ***crate scene*** and select the **Crate node**. Search collision in the inspector.

<img src="./ReadMeAssets/physicBox8.png" alt="isolated" width="300"/>

<img src="./ReadMeAssets/physicBox9.png" alt="isolated" width="300"/>

<img src="./ReadMeAssets/physicBox10.png" alt="isolated" width="300"/>

10. The mask value selected here is what the crate can be hit by, and the layer value is what the crate can block.
Our player‚Äôs collisions by default look the same, with 1 for both. To prevent the boxes from being blocked by the crates, change the layer off of 1 and select 2. Make sure 1 is dark.

<img src="./ReadMeAssets/physicBox11.png" alt="isolated" width="300"/>

11. Hit the play button and give it a test!

12. Now our player can push the boxes around, but somehow our tower disappeared? That‚Äôs because our boxes aren‚Äôt colliding with other crates and falling through each other. Change the collision settings to mask 1 and 2. Now they should interact with both layer 1 and layer 2 (and crates are on layer 2)
    
<img src="./ReadMeAssets/physicBox12.png" alt="isolated" width="300"/>

13. Give it another run and‚Ä¶ now the tower is standing properly, and we can still knock it over!

### Recoloring the crates

Before we move on, we have a lot of the same **Icon** on our screen, and it‚Äôs getting hard to tell the player apart from the rest of the level. We should change the color of the crates to add some variety.

1. Select the **Icon**, then In the inspector, search for modulate.

<img src="./ReadMeAssets/physicBox13.png" alt="isolated" width="300"/>

<img src="./ReadMeAssets/physicBox14.png" alt="isolated" width="300"/>

2. Click on the white rectangle to change the color that is being applied over the icon. It will stay white until you lower the brightness, so you may need to tweak it.
   
***Note: if you‚Äôre having trouble seeing what color is being applied, you can click the eye button next to the CollisionShape2D to make it invisible.***

<img src="./ReadMeAssets/physicBox15.png" alt="isolated" width="300"/>

<img src="./ReadMeAssets/physicBox16.png" alt="isolated" width="300"/>

3. If you go back to your level, you‚Äôll see that this automatically got applied to all our crates. This is because the crate scene is the **master copy**, and each instance of the crate in the level scene is affected by changes to the crate scene.

  ### Crate Overview

   <img src="./ReadMeAssets/bob.png" alt="isolated" width="300"/>

   - **Node2D**‚§µ
      - Add a **StaticBody2D**‚§µ
         - **Sprite2D** (Drag the Godot icon into the scene)
         - **CollisionShape2D** adjust the collision boundary

   <img src="./ReadMeAssets/rigidBody.gif" alt="isolated" width="800"/>

## 6. Expanding the level

Not that a great platformer game can‚Äôt take place on a floating island (like Cave Story or Rivals of Aether), but we‚Äôll want some extra space to start building out our level.

1. To start, let‚Äôs create a new scene for our platform so we can start duplicating it easier. Remember to fix the offset in the platform.tscn

<img src="./ReadMeAssets/level.png" alt="isolated" width="300"/>

<img src="./ReadMeAssets/level2.png" alt="isolated" width="300"/>

2. Place down some duplicate platforms and start building your level! 
   
   - To resize individual platforms, go into the inspector and change the scale.
  
   - You can drag the x and y values to change them without having to type. Be sure to unlink the x y values by clicking the link icon to the right.
  
  <img src="./ReadMeAssets/level3.png" alt="isolated" width="300"/>

3. You can optionally recolor these platforms too, just be sure to recolor them in the platform scene if you want it to apply to all of them. If you change the modulate color on the platforms in the level, it will only apply to that instance.

 <img src="./ReadMeAssets/level4.png" alt="isolated" width="300"/>

4. Bonus!! 

In the script tab you can adjust your player‚Äôs jump height by changing the **JUMP_VELOCITY** value. 

 <img src="./ReadMeAssets/level5.png" alt="isolated" width="300"/>

***Make sure to keep it negative, since negative Y is the up direction in Godot***
